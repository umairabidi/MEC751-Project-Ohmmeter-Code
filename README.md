# MEC751 Project Ohmmeter Code


This is where I will be storing code for the MEC 751 Project. Most of my notes are kept in hardcopy, so this .md will not be very detailed.

Repos:
1. A-Model:  
  This is the first prototype I am building. It will not contain all the required features, but it will work.
2. B-Model:  
  This one should have all the required features and is working, but is not perfect.
3. Final:  
  This one should be the one I submit at the end.
